var a = 1;

/*

This is because the function a() {} statement has now created a local a 
that has a functional/local scope. This new a now gets hoisted to 
the top of its enclosing function b() with it’s declaration and definition.
This is what is happening behind the scenes:

Therefore, the statement a = 10; is no longer changing the value of the global a which remains to be 1, but rather it is changing the local a from a function to an integer value of 10. Since we are logging the global a, the output is 1.

Had the statement function a() {} not been there, the output would have been 10.
